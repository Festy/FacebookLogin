 This is the basic set up for all Facebook related API and functions that will be needed for the MHacks project.

1. index.html will be the page that will ask a user to login/sign up using FB
2. If its sign up process, we want to access all the freinds  of the user from FB.
3. If the user allows, we will return the list of freinds in an array (of profile ID?)
4. Otherwise generate a notice.
5. If its not sign up, just login.

NOTE: For this project to work,
You have to either run this code on a server, or on localhost using apache server.
In both cases, you also have to register the app in your facebook developer account, and add the domain name that will be accessing the app (localhost in case of local apache server)

my facebook app is "logintester"
